	Properties of a recursive function:
		- A recursive has two types of statements
		- First one ore more base case
		- Second one or more recursive case
		- It takes up extra memory space
		
	Iteration vs recursive 
	
	Properties of a recursive function: (S. Lipsutz)
		- There must be certain criteria, called base criteria, for
		   which the procedure does not call iteself.
		- Each time the procedure calls itself (directly or indirectly),
		  it must be closer to the base criteria.
		  
		  
	if n==1, return 1;
	
	5! = 5 * 4!
	4! = 4 * 3!
	
	A recursive function with these two properties is said to be
	well-defined.

	Recursion:
		It is process in which a function calls itself.
		
	Two types of statements:
		1. Base Case
		2. Recusive Case
	
	int factorial(int n) {
		if(n==1)
			return 1;
		
		return n * factorial(n-1);
	}
	
	O(1^n)	=	O(n)
	
	How to find the complexity of a recursive function?
	
	number of calls raised to the power n.
	
	O(c^n)
	
	Which type of problems should be solved using recursion?
	
	5! = 5 x 4!
	4! = 4 x 3!
	
	
	n! = n * (n-1)!
	
	
	KISS:	Keep it Simple Stupid.
	
	DRY:	Don't Repeat Yourself.
	
	YAGNI:	You Aren't Gonna Need It.
	
	
	Time Complexity
	
	O(1)		-	Excellent
	O(log n)	-	Good
	O(n)		-	Fair
	O(n log n)	-	Bad
	O(n^2) and more	-	Horrible

	Linear structures:
		Array		-	Fixed
		Linked  List-	Flexible
		
		
		int arr[0]
		
		arr[0] - 0x10 + 0 x 4	=	0x10
		arr[1] - 0x10 + 1 x 4	=	0x14
		
	
	Stack and Queue are list with limited operations
	
		Array representation of stack/queue
		Linked-list representation of stack/queue
		
	
	Stack is used mostly in such situations where recursion is used.
	Queue is used mostly used in situation solved in sequence.
